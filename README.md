# Frontend Assignment

This is a code assignment for frontend candidates. The purpose is to give us a better understanding of your skills as a developer.

In the technical interview, you will have a chance to present the result and discuss it with future colleagues at [OneLab](https://onelab.se)!

## The Assignment

Your friend Dave is hoarding cats and he has asked you to help organize his growing furry family of cats.

As a user, one should be able to

- add cats to the collection,
- view the list of cats and their individual details (e.g. name, date of birth...)
- as well as edit the details,
- and remove cats that has gone to Cat Heaven/Valhall.

It would be nice if one could also sort and search for them, but that might be a future feature (optional).
